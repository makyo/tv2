# Terminal Velocity

Terminal Velocity is a fast note-taking app for the UNIX terminal, that
focuses on letting you create or find a note as quickly and easily as
possible, then uses your `$EDITOR` to open and edit the note. It is
heavily inspired by the OS X app [Notational
Velocity](http://notational.net/). For screenshots and features, see the
[Terminal Velocity website](http://vhp.github.com/terminal_velocity).
